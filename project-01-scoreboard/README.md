# PROJECT #1 - SCOREBOARD

First big project in JavaScript!

## Objective

Create a scoreboard that displays an indefinite number of players, which updates the score for each individual.

## Instructions

1. The scoreboard contains an indefinite number of boxes with different players.
2. Each box contains the name of the player, current score (starting from 0), a "+1 point" button and a "Delete player" button. These elements need to be created in the JS file, not in the HTML file!
3. Each player box is created using a function in JS.
4. Create a form in HTML which can add any number of players to the scoreboard.
5. Stylize the elements in a separate CSS file.

## Optional

- a "Reset" button that deletes all displayed players
- avatar for each player - Dicebear API avatars (https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/bottts-neutral/svg?seed=Andreea)
- highlight the player that has the highest score
